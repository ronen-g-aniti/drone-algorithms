# Potential Field Algorithms

Potential fields are a mathy algorithm. 
The math can be used to solve for a path.
I discovered two use cases for this approach. 
One was adjusting waypoint positions to keep waypoints further from obstacles. 
The other was acting as the basis of a receding horizon path planner. 
Both approaches require a mathematical model. 
I developed the first model, realized there were some shortcomings, then developed a second model to 
address those shortcomings. The results indicated strengths and weaknesses with potential feilds in general.
