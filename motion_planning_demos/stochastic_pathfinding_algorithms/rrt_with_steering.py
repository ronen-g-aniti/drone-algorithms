class RRT:
	"""
	A class to represent a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) for path planning in 3D space.
	RRT is a tree-based algorithm that incrementally builds a graph of states in the configuration space.
	This particular implementation incorporates hypothetical kinematic constraints on the motion of the quadcopter.
	The steering model, which I devised, is characterized by a maximum steering angle rate and a fixed speed.
	The drone's state is thus not only a position but also an orientation in 3D space, with an initial orientation that defaults
	to point directly at the goal state. 
	There is a steering axis about which the quadcopter can rotate, and the steering angle is limited by the maximum turn rate.
	Other features of this implementation include a goal bias, a maximum number of iterations, and a goal tolerance.
