	"""
	The Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) organizes points according to a graph structure, where each point is a node and the connections
	between points are edges. The roadmap is constructed by randomly sampling points in the free space of the environment and connecting 
	neighboring points that are not in collision with the obstacles of the environment. The roadmap can be used for graph-based search 
	algorithms such as A* or Dijkstra's algorithm. The PRM class provides methods to visualize the roadmap in 3D with optional path highlighting.
	
	Example:
